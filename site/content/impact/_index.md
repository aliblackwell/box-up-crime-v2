  heading: Thank You From Stephen Addison
  description: >-
    As Founder of Box Up Crime, I would just like to say a massive thank you to
    all of our supporters over the past few years. None of what we have achieved
    would have been possible without the support of investors, government,
    parents but most importantly, our young people! 


    Our future is looking bright. We have plans to expand to cover at least 16
    boroughs by the end of the year and have plans to go to Ghana and
    Switzerland too. The purpose of this is to reach as many people as possible
    with Box Up Crime. 


    Without your continued support, none of this would be possible.
