    We are a social youth organisation operating out of the London borough
    Barking and Dagenham.

    We work with young people at risk of having their lives ruined by crime and
    motivate them to rebuild and recapture their dreams and aspirations. We
    believe that every young person is entitled to a bright future, inspired by
    their hopes and dreams, regardless of their background. We are passionate
    about getting thousands of young people out of gangs each year.

    Box Up is keen to expand its presence within London, and is actively working
    to set up new branches of the organisation in five new boroughs. By seeking
    out similar local figures with an intimate knowledge of the youth and gang
    dynamics in each borough, Box Up will create a wider reaching program that
    interconnects around the city, and tackles the growing epidemic of teenage
    murders.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
